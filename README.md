multiple files while supporting timestamp-based searches.

-   View log file contents directly in the app
-   Copy log content with ease
-   Toggle log levels for better filtering


## Usage

-   **Index a folder**: Go to `File → Index Folder` and select the
    directory containing your logs
-   **Search by date range**: Enable the date range checkbox when
    searching
-   **Add custom formats/extensions**: Use `File → Settings` to add new
    file extensions and date formats
-   **Toggle log levels**: Quickly switch between different log levels
    for focused analysis
